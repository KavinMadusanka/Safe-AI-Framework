# TRUSTED FRAMEWORK FOR VIBE CODING INTEGRATION INTO STABLE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

## 🎯 Main Research Objective

To design and implement a secure, explainable, and developer-friendly framework that enables the safe integration of AI-generated code into existing stable software systems.

## 🧩 Framework Architecture (High-Level)

- The framework consists of four tightly integrated components, each addressing a critical risk in vibe coding:
- Secure Plugin Isolation & Interface Enforcement
- Secure Communication & Authentication Mechanism
- Automated AI & Rule-Based Code Visualization (UML)
- Secure-by-Design AI Code Generator

Together, these components create a real-time, security-aware vibe coding ecosystem.
