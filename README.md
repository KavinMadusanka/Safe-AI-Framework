# TRUSTED FRAMEWORK FOR VIBE CODING INTEGRATION INTO STABLE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS

## 🎯 Main Research Objective

To design and implement a secure, explainable, and developer-friendly framework that enables the safe integration of AI-generated code into existing stable software systems.

## 🧩 Framework Architecture (High-Level)

The framework consists of four tightly integrated components, each addressing a critical risk in vibe coding:
- Secure Plugin Isolation & Interface Enforcement
- Secure Communication & Authentication Mechanism
- Automated AI & Rule-Based Code Visualization (UML)
- Secure-by-Design AI Code Generator

Together, these components create a real-time, security-aware vibe coding ecosystem.

### 🔐 Secure Plugin Isolation & Interface Enforcement


### 🔑 Secure Communication & Authentication Mechanism


### 📊 Automated AI & Rule-Based Code Visualization (UML)

- Captures AI-generated code in real time
- Converts code into a Common Intermediate Representation (CIR)
- Generates UML diagrams using:
   AI-based semantic interpretation
   Regex-based deterministic parsing
- Renders UML diagrams using PlantUML
- Enables side-by-side comparison for verification
- Improves developer understanding and explainability

### 🛡️ Secure-by-Design AI Code Generator

- Enhances prompts with secure coding guidelines
- Generates code using AI models (e.g., Gemini)
- Performs real-time static code analysis
- Detects hardcoded secrets and insecure patterns
- Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities (CVEs)

Automatically replaces insecure code snippets

Outputs validated, security-compliant code
